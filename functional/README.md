## Functional prototypes of Capstone

### Build and run with Docker

The build and run processes for the functional prototypes
have been fully Dockerised. To build all components into a Docker image, make sure you have Docker
(version 20 or above recommended)
installed, and run
```
./build
```

To run with a given source file, use
```
./run <path-to-source-file>
```

You can try with the sample code in `compiler/samples` first.
