## Capstone

This repository contains the functional prototypes CapstoneEmu (in `functional/emulator`), 
CapstoneC (in `functional/compiler`), and CapstoneLib (in `functional/compiler/samples/capstone.h`),
as well as the GEM5 model used for evaluation (in `gem5`).

Make sure that you update the submodules, either by supplying
`--recurse-submodules` when you clone this repository, or with
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
afterwards.

Please check out `functional/README.md` and `gem5/README.md` for
the instructions on building and using the different components included in this repository.
